# Hashira Polynomial Decoder
````markdown

This project is a Node.js implementation for decoding polynomial points and computing the **constant term (c)** of the polynomial.

---

ðŸ“Œ How It Works
- Given encoded points in different bases, the program:
  1. Decodes them into `(x, y)` coordinates.
  2. Uses these points to determine the constant term `c`.

âš¡ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Pranay9392/hashira_2203a51533.git
   cd hashira_2203a51533
````

2. Run the project:

   ```sh
   node index.js
   ```

ðŸ§ª Example Output

When running `node index.js`, you should see results like below:

```
--- Test 1 ---
Decoded Point -> x: 1, y: 4
Decoded Point -> x: 2, y: 7
Decoded Point -> x: 3, y: 12
Decoded Point -> x: 6, y: 39
âœ… Computed constant term (c): 3

--- Test 2 ---

Do you also want me to add a **"Usage" section** showing how others can plug in their own test cases to compute constants?
